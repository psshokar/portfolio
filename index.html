    <p> Born and raised in southeast Michigan, I am the youngest of four siblings. <br> 
    Growing up in the suburbs of Detroit, I enjoyed the fun and challenges that Michigan had to offer. <br>  
    I made the most of beautiful summers, playing basketball and rollerblading around my neighborhood. <br>  
    Fall came and with it came bonfires, hay rides, and pumpkin picking with my three older siblings. <br>  
    Winter brought lots of snow, sledding, and family time around the holidays. <br>  
    Spring was filled with gardening and getting back outdoors. <br>
