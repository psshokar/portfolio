        <h2>About:</h2>
        
        <p>
        As a child, I loved sports and always found my greatest joy in playing a game of basketball with my teammates. <br>  
        <br>
        My parents and siblings attended my games, cheering me on every step of the way for the 11 years I played on a team. <br>  
        <br>
        Spending time outdoors was always a top priority for me, so I enjoyed my after-school hours on the trampoline, jungle gym, and shooting baskets on the driveway. <br>
        <br>
        
        </p>

        <p>
        In school, I enjoyed spending time with my friends, playing outside during recess, and learning from my kind-hearted teachers. <br>  
        <br>
        I attended a K-8 charter school where I began as a five-year-old Kindergarten student. <br>  
        <br>
        The uniforms, small class sizes, and strict discipline gave me a work ethic that has stuck with me throughout the years. <br>  
        <br>
        When I moved to my local public high school, I experienced a huge change, as the class sizes suddenly spiked to 35 students in each class and daily fights in the hallways. <br> 
        <br>
        It was eye-opening and challenging to continue to learn and grow in an environment so different from what I was used to. <br>
        <br>
        
        </p>
        <img src="images/hawaii.jpeg" href="https://umich.edu">
        <p>
        After graduating from high school, I took a gap year and moved to Hawai‘i Island to build an updated technology infrastructure at a Title I public school. <br>  
        <br>
        I worked with teachers to prepare their classrooms for TVs and Chromebooks, I installed AP testing software on the library computers, and I managed the school’s upgrade in their overall use of technology tools. <br> 
        <br>
        The experience was insightful and humbling.  I learned that so much of our own country, particularly in low-income areas, lacks access to the Internet and basic technology resources. <br> 
        <br>
        This pushed my desire to study Information Analysis and User Experience design at the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>.<br>  
        <br>
        My goal is to help empower communities through access to technology. <br> 
        <br>
        With access to information, community leaders all across our nation and globe will be able to change and lead their own communities for the better. <br>
